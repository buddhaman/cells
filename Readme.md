# Cells 

Biological evolution of cells. Super fast bc of cuda.

## Building
~~Make sure you have cmake, vcpkg and all necessary c++ development tools for your operating system.~~

 Cmake is gone! Simply run build.bat in an x64 Native Tools Command Prompt (you get the x64 command window when installing visual studio).
